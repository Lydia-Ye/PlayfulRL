# ðŸŽ® PlayfulRL

## Introcution

**PlayfulRL** is a personal reinforcement learning playground where I build JAX-compatible environments for simple games like 2048 and Wuziqi (Five in a Row). The goal is to learn RL and JAX by implementing game logic from scratch and building environments suitable for training agents.

### Game Environments
- `2048 (TODO)`: Grid-based sliding puzzle game (with pure logic and JAX-based step/reset API)
- `Wuziqi (TODO)`: Five-in-a-row board game (WIP)

### JAX-Compatible
All environments are written in a functional style using JAX to enable fast simulation, JIT compilation, and vectorization.
